/*

For this question, you will draw an animated solar system using p5js.

a. Set the background colour to black. Draw the Sun in the middle as a yellow circle of
size 100.

b. Draw three smaller circles to represent planets and place them at distances of 150,
250 and 350 from the centre. The sizes of these planets should be 20, 40 and 60
respectively. Draw their circular orbits in a faint grey. You will need to think about
how to position and size these orbit tracks. (2 marks)

c. Animate the planets so they orbit the sun at different speeds, following their orbit
track. The closest planet should be the fastest, the middle planet the slowest, and
the outer planet in between (you may select the speeds). To calculate the position of
a planet in each frame, you will need to use the trigonometry discussed in lecture
3.4. (2 marks)

d. Add a small moon of size 10 that orbits the outer planet at a distance of 50 from the
centre of that planet. Animate this small moon so it orbits the planet in the opposite
direction that the planet orbits the sun. (2 marks
